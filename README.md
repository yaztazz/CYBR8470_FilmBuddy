# CYBR8470_FilmBuddy
My app is a movie recommendation app called FilmBuddy. FilmBuddy is perfect for the indecisive movie watcher. It is also perfect for anyone who just needs a new movie to watch but doesnâ€™t know where to start. Movie critics are also invited to use the application and rate movies. Movies are a great form of entertainment that allow us to escape the reality of work and school. So lay back and let FilmBuddy do the work for you.
